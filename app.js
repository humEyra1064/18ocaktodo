//* load event vs. DomContentLoaded:
//? The "load" event and the "DOMContentLoaded" event are two different events in JavaScript that are triggered at different times when a web page is loading.

//? The "load" event is triggered when all elements on a page have finished loading, including images, stylesheets, and scripts.

//? The "DOMContentLoaded" event is triggered when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

//! So, the DOMContentLoaded event fires "earlier" than the load event and can be used if you want to perform some actions as soon as the DOM is ready, without waiting for other resources to finish loading.

//? If there is data in local storage, it will pull the data when the page is refreshed. ðŸ‘‡
